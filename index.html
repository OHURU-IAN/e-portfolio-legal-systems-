              I took this course because I wanted a clearer understanding of how law affects everyday life. Most of what I knew about justice came from school, family, and what I saw around me, but I never understood how the legal system actually works. Learning about the Constitution, sources of law, courts, and citizenship helped me see how law shapes society and my own responsibilities in it. This course has made me more aware, more curious, and more confident about how justice works in Kenya.

          <h4>Course Purpose (Academic Summary)</h4>
          <p class="placeholder">
            This course explains how law works in society and why it matters for everyday life. It shows how legal systems maintain order, settle disputes, and protect people's rights. We explored how law connects with social values like justice, fairness, and equality, and how it shapes the relationship between citizens, the state, and political institutions. The course also introduces both Kenyan and international legal systems, helping us understand how laws are created, applied, and interpreted in different contexts.

            <p class="placeholder">
              At first, I expected this course to just explain basic legal concepts, but it ended up giving me a much deeper understanding of how law, society, and politics connect. I now see why legal systems matter for every citizen, not just lawyers. Learning about rights, responsibilities, and how laws are created and applied helped me understand the bigger picture of how a country functions. This course is important for my programme and for life in Kenya because it teaches awareness, accountability, and how to engage with issues that affect society every day.

        <h4>LO1 - Content</h4>
        <div class="meta">Definitions of law | law and society | norms &amp; social control</div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Short explanation of how the course defined law:</strong> The course explained law as a set of formal rules created by the state to guide behaviour, maintain order, protect rights, and resolve disputes in society.</li>
          <li><strong>Difference between informal norms and formal legal rules:</strong> Informal norms like mores and folkways are unwritten cultural expectations we follow out of habit or tradition, while formal legal rules are written laws that the government can enforce through institutions like the police and courts.</li>
          <li><strong>One example of law as social control or dispute resolution:</strong> An example of law as social control is how traffic laws regulate road behaviour and prevent accidents. They help keep order and ensure safety for everyone.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="reflection-box">
          <div class="reflection-label">Reflection for LO1</div>
          <p class="placeholder">
            One idea that changed how I think about law was learning the difference between social norms and formal legal rules. I realised that many things we follow in daily life, like manners or cultural expectations, are not "laws," but they still guide behaviour. What stood out most was understanding law as a form of social control that helps keep order. For example, even something as simple as traffic laws shows how society uses rules to prevent chaos and protect people. This made me start noticing how law quietly operates in the background of everyday life.

        <div class="meta">Substantive vs procedural | public vs private | civil vs criminal</div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Substantive vs procedural law (with examples):</strong><br>Substantive law defines people's rights and duties, such as criminal offences or contract rights. Procedural law explains the steps and processes used to enforce those rights, like how a case is filed in court or how evidence is handled.</li>
          <li><strong>Public vs private law (with examples):</strong><br>Public law deals with issues between individuals and the state, such as constitutional law or criminal law. Private law deals with relationships between individuals or organisations, like contract law or family law.</li>
          <li><strong>Civil vs criminal law (difference in purpose/proof):</strong><br>Criminal law punishes offences against the state and requires proof beyond reasonable doubt. Civil law resolves disputes between individuals and usually requires proof on a balance of probabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="reflection-box">
          <div class="reflection-label">LO2 - Reflection</div>
          <p class="placeholder">
            I find criminal law the most interesting because it shows how society responds to wrongdoing and protects public safety. Hearing real cases in Kenya, especially those involving corruption or violent crime, made me realise how important fair investigation and evidence are. It also connects to my programme because understanding crime, justice, and accountability helps me think more critically about society and decision-making.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Main sources of Kenyan law (in order):</strong> Constitution (supreme law), Acts of Parliament, delegated legislation, judicial precedent (common law/doctrine of stare decisis), African customary law where applicable, and Islamic law in personal matters for Muslims.</li>
          <li><strong>Where African customary law and Islamic law apply:</strong> Customary law applies in communities where it is not repugnant to justice and morality, often in family, land, or succession matters. Islamic law applies mainly in personal status issues (marriage, divorce, inheritance) for consenting Muslims.</li>
          <li><strong>International law and treaties:</strong> Ratified treaties become part of Kenyan law under Article 2(6) of the Constitution. International norms can influence court decisions and legislation, especially in human rights and cross-border matters.</li>

          <p class="placeholder">
            Understanding where law comes from helps ordinary Kenyans know their rights, duties, and the limits of state power. Legal pluralism (recognising constitutional, statutory, customary, religious, and international sources) can be a strength because it respects diversity, but it also creates challenges when systems conflict. Seeing how these sources interact makes me more aware of how justice is balanced in everyday life.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rights, duties and public participation under the Kenyan Constitution:</strong><br>I learned that the Constitution protects basic rights such as equality, freedom of expression, and access to justice, while also giving citizens duties like obeying the law, respecting others, and participating in national processes like elections and public discussions.</li>
          <li><strong>Key ideas about international law / human rights:</strong><br>International law promotes global standards for human rights, peace, and cooperation between countries. It helps guide how nations treat people and solve issues that cross borders.</li>
          <li><strong>Other legal traditions (religious or customary law):</strong><br>We also studied how systems like religious law and African customary law handle justice. These traditions influence family matters, conflict resolution, and moral expectations in some communities.</li>

            This course made me more aware of my role as a Kenyan citizen. Learning about rights, duties, and how the Constitution works encouraged me to think more seriously about voting responsibly, participating in society, and speaking out against corruption. It also taught me to respect different legal traditions and understand how justice can be viewed from different cultural and global perspectives. Overall, it helped me see law not just as rules, but as something that guides how we live together as a community.

          In the early weeks, we focused on understanding what law is, how society uses norms to guide behaviour,
          and why formal rules are needed to maintain order. This helped me build a foundation for the rest of the course.

            At the start of the course, I only had a basic idea of what law was, mostly from everyday life and things I saw online. The early classes helped me understand how law, norms, and society connect, which was new to me. In the middle weeks, learning about the Kenyan legal system and the Constitution made everything more real, especially how rights and institutions actually work. Later on, topics like international law and different legal traditions pushed me to think more broadly about justice. Overall, the course changed how I look at law, from something far away to something that shapes everyday life.

    <!-- SUPREME COURT TRIP -->
    <section id="trip">
      <h3>Supreme Court Class Trip</h3>
      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <span class="tag">What I observed</span>
          <p>
            During our visit to the Judiciary Museum of Kenya-located in the basement of the Supreme Court of Kenya building-I discovered there is much more to the court than simply courtrooms. Ahead of our tour I did not realise the museum existed. Inside, we encountered exhibits showing traditional dispute resolution (a Kikuyu mugumo tree scene), historical artefacts, and displays about freedom fighters like Dedan Kimathi and the Kapenguria Six. The museum captured Kenya's judicial history-from customary systems, through colonial courts, to contemporary constitutional law.

        <div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Connecting to My Programme</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>For business: Stability and clear dispute-resolution mechanisms (like those embodied in the Supreme Court's role) support investor confidence and ethical governance.</li>
              <li>For IT: The museum and court infrastructure hinted at how digital systems (e-filing, case-management, archives) might support transparency and access to justice in Kenya.</li>
              <li>For journalism: The exhibits reinforced the importance of media access, historical records, and how understanding legal tradition strengthens accurate reporting and informed public discussion.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="reflection-box">
            <div class="reflection-label">Personal reaction</div>
            <p class="placeholder">
              I felt both surprised and impressed during the visit. I did not expect a dedicated museum inside the Supreme Court, and seeing how legal history is displayed-from tree-based dispute resolution to colonial courts to modern constitutional justice-shifted my view of law. The visit increased my trust in the justice system's ability to evolve and serve the people. It made me realise that justice is not only about what happens in the courtroom-it is about culture, history, access, and how ordinary citizens engage with law.

            <li><strong>Knowing my rights and duties under the Constitution:</strong> Learning about rights like equality, freedom of expression and access to information has made me more confident in speaking up and participating in public matters. Understanding my duties-such as obeying the law and respecting others-also makes me more responsible in how I act as a citizen.</li>
            <li><strong>Connecting legal knowledge to my future career:</strong> This course showed me how important the law is in every field. Whether it is business, IT or media, understanding legal rules helps in decision-making, professionalism, and avoiding legal problems at work. It also strengthens ethical behaviour, especially when dealing with information or technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Resisting corruption or abuse of power:</strong> The course helped me recognise why corruption harms society and how small actions-like refusing bribes, reporting wrongdoing or demanding transparency-can support fairness and accountability in everyday situations.</li>

              This course taught me practical ways to use legal knowledge outside the classroom. First, it has influenced how I plan to vote-by choosing leaders who respect the Constitution and promote accountability. Second, it has changed how I act in everyday situations by making me more alert to corruption and unfair practices. I now feel more confident standing up for my rights, asking questions, and supporting transparency in my community.

        <h4>Final Reflection (Looking Back - and Forward)</h4>
        <p>
          The biggest idea I am taking away from this course is how closely law is connected to everyday life. At the start, I thought law was something distant that only lawyers dealt with, but now I see how rights, duties, justice, and even public discussions are shaped by the legal system.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I will remember in the future is our visit to the Supreme Court and learning how Kenya's legal system has grown from traditional practices to modern constitutional justice. That experience changed the way I view the courts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this course has made me more aware, more responsible, and more confident as a Kenyan citizen. It pushed me to think about the kind of citizen I want to be: someone who respects the law, participates in society, and stands for fairness wherever possible.
